# UFO Sightings with Javascript
Data Bootcamp Week 12

## Overview of Project
This exercise involved using JavaScript to create a dynamic table by user-entered information on specific criteria.

The guided homework portion of the exercise involved building a webpage using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, D3, and JavaScript. The exercise involved building a table, populating it with the data (provided in JSON format), and creating the ability to filter by date only, after clicking a button.

The independent challenge portion of the exercise involved revisions to the homework exercise, namely adding four additional filters (city, state, country, and shape), registered in an event listener that functions on user-entered input rather than on clicking a button. One or more filters can be used.

## Results
In the latest version of the webpage, the filter search section includes five fields where a user can enter information, as shown in the image below. All available data is shown in the table.
